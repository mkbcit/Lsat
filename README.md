### Lsat [Liliaceae micro-Satellite Analysis Tool] 
Introduction: 
Lsat is web-based micro-satellite analysis tool for family Liliaceae. 
This tool developed for the identification and characterization of perfect microsatellites from the Lily transcriptome data. 
Lsat is user-friendly, easy to use, no programming language knowledge need to use it, it is totally online based microsatellite analysis tool. 
This tool provides more in depth analysis of microsatellite e.g. classify SSR according to Motif length (ClassI>20nt and ClassII=20nt),
Motif nucleotide base composition (AT-rich, GC-rich and AT/GC balance), extract flanking region of the SSR loci etc. 
these analytical features are the unique for this tool compare to others existing Microsatellite analysis tools.

###  2. Characteristics of the Input data:
2.1 Lily EST NCBI: Collection of 4099 EST sequences of Lilium species from the NCBI.

2.2 Lily nr Unigene (Lily non redudant unigene sequence ): 216768 non-redundant lily unigenes were generated from the 22 cDNA library sequencing by Illumina sequencing technology, followed by denovo assembling using Trinity and CAP3.
